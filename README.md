# BCIT Assignment Tracker

Given:
- React Project built using vitejs
- HTML/CSS

Implemented functionality:
- Disable/Enable create button based on existing string on the input field
- Create button onclick adds new assignment to list
- Adding/completing assignments updates the list counters
- Clicking trash icon deletes assignment

## (Possible issue): Failed to fetch dynamically imported module
Solution: delete the ```node_modules``` directory and re-install it using ```npm install```
